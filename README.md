#CSI 180 Semester Project
##Tea

This repository will be used to document my progress in creating a website that holds information about, and compares different types of tea

Goals:
- [x] Record necessary information about teas for website
- [ ] Sculpt the baseline of the site in html
- [ ] Input information about each tea into corresponding corners of the site
- [ ] Make the website expandable for future inputs
